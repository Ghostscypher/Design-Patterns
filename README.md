This is simply a collection of notes from <https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns>
I'd highly recommend that you read the articles found here. Just writing them here for future reference.

The notes are here for future reference, and even though it can technically be used for reading, they have been summarized as as I saw best. Therefore i'd still highly encourage you to read all the data material the above link.

The notes are written in markdown in a jupyter notebook.

To the author (Alexander Shvets) of the articles, A huge thank you, I have learned so much from the above.
